<h2>Every test lies under some group. The parent level group is also known as department (eg: BioChemistry).
   Then there is a subgroup. A subgroup is just a collection of certain tests.
    A test can either stay alone(without subgroup) or it can be inside a subgroup. While viewing the report,
     each department or group will have tests, or its subgroups which will have tests in it, or both.
      Whether its a group, subgroup or test, it will have cost, interpretation and specifications of their own. </h2>
