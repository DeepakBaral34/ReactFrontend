<h2>Patient entry is a desk job and is an important module. This section will collect personal and physical
   information of the patient and prepare a barcode with that information. Then the second part of this
    will collect test related data from the patient prescription report. This section will be built taking
    care that users don't have to use their mouse frequently. Once the key enters the input field of test selection,
     the use of the mouse should come only after the test entry is completed. The input field for test selection
      is a type ahead  field which will bring a list of tests matching typed characters and using arrow buttons,
       a test will be filtered and its selected using the enter key button.
